                    <h4>The National Disability Insurance Scheme: What Is It?</h4>
                    <p>Australians with disabilities can now access additional support services under the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS). The NDIS gives customers a choice and control over their experience, in contrast to earlier programs that were standardized and offered few individually tailored services. You can select your NDIS provider and develop a person-centered plan for the services and assistance you require under the new system.
                        <br><br>
                        The NDIS was introduced in 2013 and will be implemented until 2020. It presently provides around $22 billion for an estimated 500,000 Australians who qualify. The new system offers choice and individualization, which improves support for those who require it.</p>
